# WineLister

Had to learn flask for a school project, the goal was to do a todolist but i managed to do a little website where you are able to manage your wine's stock
the code architecture is pretty fine imo but still a lot to improve, i've never done any css before and design, and i think you can feel it, i'll try to use
more css for my future project in order to master it asap.
